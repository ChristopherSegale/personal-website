Here are the files used to create my website.  These files are dependent on the 'Serve Website' program in order to be deployed.

Instructions:
Put the 'contents.wpt' file in the same directory as where the 'Serve Website' program is to be compiled.  You may have to delete the example file of the same name that is included in the repository of 'Serve Website'.  In addition, copy the 'img' directory to the 'web-resources' directory of where the program is being compiled.  Once the 'make' command has been issued, my personal website should be compiled.
